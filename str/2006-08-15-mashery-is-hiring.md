# Mashery is Hiring

[Mashery](http://www.technorati.com/tags/mashery), the company I recently co-founded with [Oren Michels](http://oren.blogs.com/praxis), is looking to add a multi-talented PHP developer to its engineering team. The job description is below. The posting hasn’t gone out widely yet, as I figure the really good people read the [Planet PHP](http://www.planet-php.net/) feed that picks up my posts in this category.

So, hop on this now if you’re interested, before it goes out to the teeming hordes.

> Stellar PHP Developer
>
> We’re looking for a kick-ass PHP developer. Someone who’s done a lot, and seen even more.
>
> Someone who’s intimately familiar with PHP 5 OOP practices (we require PHP 5 E\_STRICT clean code internally). Someone who doesn’t necessarily love writing unit tests, but loves what unit tests provide. Someone who strives to produce better code every day, and who’s open to new ways of doing just that.
>
> Our ideal candidate will be someone familiar with the pros and cons of SOAP vs XML-RPC vs REST. Someone who knows what JSON stands for, and why it’s cool. Someone who’s a Savant, not a Smarty. Someone who cares about documenting their source carefully, and believes in decent commit messages (at least 85% of the time).
>
> We think that a good fit for our team is someone who can (and does) compile their own builds of PHP for local development.
>
> We’re looking for more than just a code guru, though. We’re looking for someone who can work well with others. Someone who understands that “perfect” can’t get in the way of “pretty damn good.” Someone who can accept suggestions for improvements from team members without getting defensive. Someone who understands that we’re a business–so we have to ship to generate revenue.
>
> Our person is someone who realizes that what goes into production must fail gracefully on the rare occasions that it fails.
>
> Our person is also very likely an open source contributor — someone who may already know the PHP community people we have on the team now.
>
> Our person is someone well versed in a wide variety of tools and techniques, but is someone who’s had experience with [Prototype and script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us/), and has spent some time basking in the rays of the [Solar PHP 5 framework](http://solarphp.com/). Our person probably even has some C and/or Python chops stashed in the closet.
>
> Finally, our person is someone who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.
>
> Are you our someone?
>
> If so — and you know who you are — introduce yourself to us at jobs [@] mashery dot com.
