# Blog Overhaul In Progress

I’ve switched to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) from [Serendipity](http://s9y.org/) for a variety of reasons. Those of you who get my feed via [Planet PHP](http://www.planet-php.net/), sorry about the double-posting if that’s what winds up happening. Heads up to those wanting to switch to WordPress from s9y via “import from RSS” functionality: WordPress will not follow the links in your s9y-exported RSS.

So, I’ll be importing comments made to old posts as time permits.

This blog theme is also temporary — I’m in the midst of a complete site makeover with the aid of the talented [Matt Brett](http://mattbrett.com/). So stay tuned for the next incarnation; this is just a design intermission to make the site more readable in the interim. Meanwhile, bbbrrrrryyyy brrrreeeport and all that.
