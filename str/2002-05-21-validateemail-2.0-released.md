# validateEmail 2.0 Released

May 21, 2002 -- A much needed updating of the validateEmail function created in '98 by Jon S. Stevens, and updated by Shane Gibson, berber, and Frank Vogel over time. Several new features have been added, including an improved "wait" routine for sluggish hosts, and RFC 2821-compliant SMTP command formatting to eliminate "hang" problems caused by attempts to validate on certain hosts.

I realize there is quite a bit of controversy over the validation methods used by this script -- therefore, some people may not favor it. However, I feel it's an effective first line of defense against the "asdfd@lkjlakh.com" sort of garbage, etc. Those who use validateEmail now will find this to be a useful upgrade.
