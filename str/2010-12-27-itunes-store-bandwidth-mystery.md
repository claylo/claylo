# iTunes Store Bandwidth Mystery

I've got two internet connections at my house. A 50Mbps Comcast cable
connection, and a 3Mbps AT&T U-verse connection. I'd had an
18Mbps U-verse connection, and I didn't want to drop it entirely (nice
to have a backup), so dialed it back to the lowest 3Mbps flavor when I
got my Comcast connection.

According to Ookla's
[speedtest.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20130301131808/http://speedtest.net/),
both connections are performing as advertised from my MacBook Pro. In
fact, I routinely get 55Mbpsfrom Comcast on Ookla's tests.

Last night, I rented a few episodes of Lie to Me Season 3 from the
iTunes Store. Rather than stream them, I used the same MacBook Pro I'd
used for the Ookla tests. I have a first-gen AppleTV, so couldn't rent
the episodes directly from the tube.

When connected to Comcast, moments after getting a 55Mbps test result,
iTunes told me downloading a 1.4GB would take a whopping 8 hours.

For fun, I paused the download, disconnected from Comcast and hooked up
to my 3Mbps U-verse connection, then resumed the download. Presto: ready
to watch in 70 minutes.

Now, I'm no genius, and my brains are still semi-scrambled from a week+
with the flu. But how else do you explain the above scenario other than
Comcast throttling iTunes downloads?

> In this instance, Comcast's download speed would have been lower than 512 Kbps, which translates to 64 kB/sec. A 70 minute download time would be close to the top speed for your 3 Mbps connection. If I had no experience with Comcast, I might say that what you are saying has credence, but I think you just had a bad connection, which, as we know, can be caused by a variety of factors. I routinely use iTunes with my Comcast connection, and my speed is usually between 1-2 MB/sec., which is about right for my 20 Mbps cable modem.
