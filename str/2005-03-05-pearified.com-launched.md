# Pearified.com Launched

I'm happy to say that I've just launched
[Pearified.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20050405162300/http://www.pearified.com/),
a new PEAR-compatible repository. Pearified is driven by [PEAR
1.4.0](https://web.archive.org/web/20050405162300/http://pear.php.net/)'s
new channels capability.

PEAR Channels are an excellent addition to PEAR, and Pearified.com
allows for the PEAR-friendly distribution of packages that I've long
wished were as easy to install as regular PEAR packages are.

A thousand THANK YOU!!!!s go out to [Greg
Beaver](https://web.archive.org/web/20050405162300/http://greg.chiaraquartet.net/),
without whom PEAR 1.4.0 very well might never have happened. Thanks to
Greg, PEAR channels kick some serious ass.

Got any ideas for future additions to Pearified.com? I've got an
[ADOdb](https://web.archive.org/web/20050405162300/http://adodb.sourceforge.net/)
package in the works already, and am open to other suggestions.
