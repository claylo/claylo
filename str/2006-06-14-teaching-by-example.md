# Teaching by Example

This week’s news that [Om Malik is leaving Business 2.0 to head up his own start-up](http://gigaom.com/2006/06/12/its-time-to-transition/) is interesting and exciting. I don’t know Om, but I’ve been a reader of his blog and his work in Business 2.0 for several years. He’s definitely a smart guy, and I wish him the best in his new venture.

It’s particularly interesting that Om’s last big article for Business 2.0 was [How to Build a Bulletproof Start-Up](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/startups/index.html), which has been dubbed by [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/how_to_shoot_a_bullet_through_your_startup.php) as the blueprint for now NOT to do a start-up.

[Om mentioned yesterday](http://gigaom.com/2006/06/13/many-thanks/) that he felt he’d be blogging **more** (!) now that he’s on his own. I hope he’s able to do that, and he’ll keep his readers posted on how closely he follows the steps he outlined in his last Business 2.0 article. It would be extremely valuable for current and would-be entrepreneurs to hear about how well that guide holds up in practice in the real world.

Onward and upward, Om! Please keep us posted.
