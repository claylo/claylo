# Pro::PHP Podcast Follow-up

Just a quick post to follow-up on [my enjoyable chat with Marcus Whitney last Friday](http://podcast.phparch.com/podcast/audio/20060324.mp3) on the [php|architect Pro::PHP Podcast](http://podcast.phparch.com/).

* The pops and occasional gaps in my responses were a result of my headset (I think). As a podcast and VoIP rookie, I’d just purchased the headset the day before the interview. Sorry about that; I think the issues were on my end, not php|a’s.
* One more shout-out to [Paul M. Jones](http://www.paul-m-jones.com/blog/) for [Savant3](http://www.phpsavant.com/yawiki/index.php?area=Savant3), as well as [Solar](http://solarphp.com/). We use Savant3 for the [Feedster](http://www.feedster.com/) templating engine, and it’s truly a great templating package. Simple, elegant, easy. Highly recommended. While we didn’t use Solar in Feedster’s rewrite, several of the design decisions we made in the quickie frontend controller system we implemented were influenced by Paul’s work on Solar.
* A huge shout-out to [Greg Beaver](http://greg.chiaraquartet.net/) for his work on [PEAR 1.4](http://pear.php.net/package/PEAR) and PEAR channels. In the midst of our lively discussion about [Pearified.com](http://www.pearified.com/), I realized listening after the fact that Marcus and I failed to mention Greg. I don’t think Greg can be thanked enough for his work on PEAR. He’s certainly made my life easier, and the hundreds of people who’ve installed packages from Pearified.com owe Greg a “thank you” as well.

Finally, thanks again to Marcus Whitney and Sean Coates for their invitation to do the interview. I appreciate the opportunity to share my experiences with PHP 5 in a demanding production environment, and always enjoy spreading the word about Pearified.com.

Thanks, guys!
