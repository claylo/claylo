# Web Developer Toolbar for Internet Exploder 6

Angels could be heard singing softly in the background as I discovered the [Internet Exploder Developer Toolbar](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&displaylang=en) this morning, just in time to debug a bit of fresh insanity produced by IE6’s rendering of CSS otherwise deemed perfectly OK by Firefox, Safari and Opera.

A boon to myself and others who frequently groan in irritation over getting pulled away from PHP development to while away hours dealing with IE6 CSS rendering issues. It’s not nearly as good as the [Firefox Web Dev extension](http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/), but it’s far better than nothing.
