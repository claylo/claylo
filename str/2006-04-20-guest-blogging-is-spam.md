# Guest Blogging is Spam

[Om](http://daily.gigaom.com/2006/04/19/boris-i-am-listening/), this sentiment is going around. I posted on it yesterday, but seems to be worth mentioning again.

As Boris suggests, \*link\* to the different voices. Having someone else write on your blog really violates the premise that your subscribers subscribed under.

Subscribers generally subscribe to read \*your\* voice. They did not subscribe to read the voices of others … perhaps *your opinion* on the voices of others, but once the line is crossed into an actual full guest post, you’re now sending subscribers something they didn’t sign up for.

I’ll stick my neck out here a bit: **Guest blogging is a new form of spam.**

Crazy, you say?

Not really. A base definition of spam is “[unsolicited or undesired bulk electronic messages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam),” after all. A [full discourse on what spam is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29) covers a lot of ground (and I realize that the definition of spam is a hotly debated topic) … but the general gist is that **spam is something I don’t want that I’m getting anyway**. Doesn’t have to be commercial — it just has to be an unsolicited message distributed in a bulk fashion.

In other words: a guest blog post.

Sorry guys, it is what it is.
