# PHP 5.1.3 Advisory

I just saw [this post](http://www.phpdeveloper.org/news/5300) over on PHPDeveloper.org, which refers to [this](http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=37276) scary-sounding bug relating to $\_POST array behavior in PHP 5.1.3.

If you haven’t upgraded yet (as I have not), it might make sense to wait this out a day or two to see what happens next. Thanks to all those who caught this and reported it.
