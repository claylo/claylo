# Release Your Next Project as a PEAR 1.4.0 Package

The timing on this couldn’t be better, with PEAR 1.4.0 going into beta in a few days.

[![php|a August 2005](http://www.killersoft.com/img/pubs/phpa-august2005.jpg)](http://www.phparch.com/issue.php?mid=63 "Get the issue from php|architect")My latest [php|architect](http://www.phparch.com/) article is out in the [August 2005](http://www.phparch.com/issue.php?mid=63) issue. The synopsis reads:

> With the release of a stable PEAR 1.4.0 installer on the horizon, now is a good time to get familiar with the new features provided by PEAR 1.4.0 that can make distribution of your open source and proprietary libraries and applications easier than ever before. Returning author Clay Loveless gives you a practical example in this piece.

The practical example is … [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/). I’ll be releasing the PEAR packaged [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/) application later today on [Pearified.com](http://www.pearified.com/).

While I’m at it, I’m planning a Pearified.com release of [JPSpan](http://jpspan.sourceforge.net/) as well, which will help those of you following [Josh Eichorn](http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/)’s AJAX examples. [Harry Fuecks](http://www.phppatterns.com/) and I talked about putting JPSpan up on Pearified.com a few weeks ago, and I’ve gotten bogged down in other aspects of the site. So, stay tuned for a few Pearified.com releases today. 😁
