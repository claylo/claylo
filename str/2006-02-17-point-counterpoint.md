# Point, Counterpoint

While most of the comments on my “[Walk the Walk](http://www.killersoft.com/randomstrings/2006/02/16/walk-the-walk-before-talking-the-talk/)” post have been very positive, [Scott Johnson](http://www.fuzzyblog.com/) wasn’t convinced that my points regarding discipline, particularly when working alone, were valid.

Be sure to [listen to one of his latest podcasts](http://fuzzyblog.com/archives/2006/02/17/confessions-of-a-middle-aged-php-hacker/) for his point of view on when it’s okay bend the “rules” that I suggested yesterday.

If you’re not a regular podcast listener, consider making an exception in this case. Scott has a viewpoint that’s worth hearing. It’s a little over twelve minutes long, and a good listen.

What do you think?
