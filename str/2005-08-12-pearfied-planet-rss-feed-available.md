# Pearfied Planet RSS Feed Available

Following up on my post from a few days ago, the Pearfied Planet RSS feed is now available.

Named in honor of the Planet PHP feed, as well as the desire **to** PEARify the planet, the feed aggregates package release announcements from Pearified.com, pear.php.net, and all other PEAR channels in the Pearified Channel Directory.

The feed is available at: [http://pearified.com/planet.xml](http://pearified.com/planet.xml)
