# Note: LAMP Isn’t About Perl or Python

I hate to be the bad guy here, but the ‘P’ in the LAMP stack is about [PHP](http://www.php.net/).

I’m not making this up. The [Wikipedia entry for the LAMP software bundle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) points back to [the article that coined the term](http://www.heise.de/ct/english/98/12/230/), and the author there clearly states that LAMP stands for Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP.

Anyone else writing [tutorial articles](http://www.chauy.com/2006/02/lamp-the-most-popular-server-system-ever/), please make note of this. Perl and Python understandably want to hang out with the cool kids, but those languages are LAMP afterthoughts latching onto the ‘P’ in LAMP like a puppy dry-humping PHP’s leg.

I’m not saying that any one language is better than another, but I just can’t stand reading articles that define LAMP as an acronym that includes or originally included those other ‘P’ languages.

Speaking of acronyms, when is the **LAMR** software stack acronym going to catch on?
