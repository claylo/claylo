# Free Beer in Atlanta

## AKA: Mashery Recruiting at php\|works

The company I had pleasure of co-founding last summer is once again on
the prowl for top-notch, Zend Certified PHP developers.

We're taking the hunt for these folks to
[php\|works](https://web.archive.org/web/20080229205532/http://works.phparch.com/)
in Atlanta. Whenever possible,
[Mashery](https://web.archive.org/web/20080229205532/http://www.mashery.com/)
will be luring the quality developers with free beer.

That's right: free beer that is [free, as in
beer](https://web.archive.org/web/20080229205532/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_Libre).

We're also sponsoring a lunch on BOTH Sept 13 and 14, as a good coder
knows she cannot code on beer alone.

Show anyone from
[Mashery](https://web.archive.org/web/20080229205532/http://www.mashery.com/)
some proof that you recently took a PHP 5 Zend Certification Exam or are
already PHP 5-Zend Certified, and we'll enter your name in a drawing for
a free [8GB Apple iPod
Touch](https://web.archive.org/web/20080229205532/http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/).

## Cool, but Why Mashery?

![Mashery](images/mashery-logo.png) Aside
from the beer and a chance at a kick-ass iPod, why would you care about
Mashery?

Well ...

-   Mashery is doing demanding PHP work at the bleeding edge of today's
    most exciting technologies, such as mobile applications, AJAX and of
    course, web services.

-   We work with cool tools like Amazon EC2 and S3. And we *work* them
    hard.

-   Mashery's clients represent a growing stable of very high volume web
    services. We tune our services to shave milliseconds off their
    runtime, and pound on PHP until it (occasionally) weeps.

... among other things.

After more than a year since co-founding Mashery, I can honestly say
that in my ten years of working with PHP, I have never had more fun. The
work is very hard, but very rewarding. And, it's always interesting; as
a "smart proxy" operator, Mashery's engineers are constantly facing new
challenges and solving them in creative ways.

Never a dull moment, as they say. That's Mashery.
