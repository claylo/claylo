# Savant Gets Pearified

In the first of what may become a series of “sub channels,” I’m happy to announce that [Paul M. Jones’](http://paul-m-jones.com/) excellent [Savant2 and Savant3](http://phpsavant.com/) packages are now available from the [savant.pearified.com](http://savant.pearified.com/) channel.

While the Savant packages have always been PEAR-installable, installing and upgrading Savant is now easier than ever.

Enjoy!
