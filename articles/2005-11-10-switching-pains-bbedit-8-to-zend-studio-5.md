# Switching Pains: BBEdit 8 to Zend Studio 5

I really, really want to be benefitting from Zend Studio 5. Really. Despite my gripes about the install process, [similar to problems others have had](http://golgote.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2005/11/08/very-first-impressions-of-zend-studio-installation-on-mac.html), I’ve got it installed, and it’s running well.

However, as a decade-long user of BBEdit, I continue to try to do things in the usual way (for me), and find that I can’t.

Note: I mention all of this because I would appreciate any tips anyone has for workarounds. I’m not bitching just to bitch. I’ve submitted several of these to Zend as feature requests already.

For example:

* **No Shift Left/Shift Right**  
  In BBEdit, I can select a block of code and use command-] to shift the entire block one tab stop to the right, and command-[ to shift the block one tab stop to the left. Intending within the selected block remains unchanged going to the right, and it remains unchanged going to the left until you hit the left document margin, at which point tab values (an actual tab, or 4 spaces) are subtracted from the left for each `command-[`. In Zend Studio … nothing like this appears to exist.
* **Double-clicking white space**  
  In BBEdit, a nice time-saver is the ability to double-click whitespace to select that block of whitespace. In Zend Studio, double-clicking whitespace does nothing.
* **Only one project window at a time**  
  Perhaps this is the cost of getting used to a true IDE for PHP work instead of using something like BBEdit. With BBEdit 8, I’ve gotten very used to the [document drawers](http://www.barebones.com/images/bbedit/document-drawer-lg.jpg) and [file groups](http://www.barebones.com/images/bbedit/file-group-large.jpg), which allow me to keep project files accessible through one window *and* allows me to flip between projects rapidly without Zend Studio’s cumbersome project switching.
* **Subversion or CVS, but not both**  
  Anyone out there who uses Subversion able to avoid CVS entirely? Didn’t think so. The day may come (or not … sigh) but until it does, Subversion fans have to swtich Zend Studio application-wide preferences to flip between SVN and CVS. BBEdit, on the other hand, gives access to SVN, CVS and Perforce source control menus on a per-file basis.

Those are the main items bugging me. I would appreciate any tips that anyone may have on these — the Shift Left/Shift Right functionality is what I’m missing the most.
