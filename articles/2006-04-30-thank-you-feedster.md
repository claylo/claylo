# Thank you, Feedster

Along with colleagues and good friends [Oren Michels](http://oren.blogs.com/praxis/) and [James Gross](http://www.jamesgross.com/), one of the days in April was my last as a [Feedster](http://www.feedster.com/) employee.

My time at Feedster, while brief at eight months, was tremendously valuable and I am grateful for the opportunity to have been part of such a great team. It has been a particularly enriching experience both personally and professionally.

I sincerely believe that with Feedster’s revamped PHP 5 code base, they’re in a fantastic position to continue building and scaling toward all their future holds. I look forward to following each chapter of their upcoming successes.

Most of all, I’m thankful for the many friends I’ve made along the way. Looking forward to working with you guys again in the future — it’s a small valley, after all.
