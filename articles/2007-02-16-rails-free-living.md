# Rails-Free Living

As I said [awhile
ago](/2005/10/why-php-will-never-have-rails/),
and as [others have
said](https://web.archive.org/web/20080229205517/http://www.soledadpenades.com/2007/01/22/php-will-never-have-a-real-rails-like-framework/)
more recently ... I feel compelled to say it again:

-   [Pipes](https://web.archive.org/web/20080229205517/http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/01/07/my_birthday_present_to_the_world_pipes_i)
    (not the Yahoo! kind)
-   [WebMesh](https://web.archive.org/web/20080229205517/http://www.phpdeveloper.org/news/7292)
-   [Stubbles](https://web.archive.org/web/20080229205517/http://www.stubbles.net/)

.... yeah. PHP will definitely never have anything unifying like Rails.

Meanwhile, I encourage you to join up with the
[Solar](https://web.archive.org/web/20080229205517/http://solarphp.com/)
community (as I have done instead of launching my own framework) ...
you'll be glad you did.

> Honestly, I don’t know if I ever want to use RoR again. Yes, I’ve used it on a project and I’ve done all the funky examples. But I bet 2/3 of the people using it can not give you any information from what’s underneath the core due to its generator and all the neat stuff that is supposed to ease the workload. I seriously doubt the quality of code (which is of cause not a problem for RoR alone, but in many other frameworks as well).
