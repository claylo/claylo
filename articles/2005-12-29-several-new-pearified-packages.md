# Several New Pearified Packages

I rolled out several new [Pearified.com](http://pearified.com/) packages last night and this morning. A brief summary of these updates:

* **Frontend packages switched to Role\_Web usage.** Packages that have a frontend component now require the [Role\_Web](http://pearified.com/index.php?package=Role_Web) custom role. This allows you to set a `web_dir` value via PEAR config. See a description of this plan [here](http://www.killersoft.com/randomstrings/2005/12/19/13-A-Call-for-Feedback.html).
* **Prototype, script.aculo.us and Behaviour packages updated.** [script.aculo.us](http://pearified.com/index.php?package=JavaScript_Scriptaculous) and [Behavior](http://pearified.com/index.php?package=JavaScript_Behaviour) actually have new versions, while the [Prototype](http://pearified.com/index.php?package=JavaScript_Prototype) package was just re-built to use [Role\_Web](http://pearified.com/index.php?package=Role_Web).
* **New Editors category added.** I’ve packaged TinyMCE 2.0.1 as [Editors\_TinyMCE](http://pearified.com/index.php?package=Editors_TinyMCE) to kick off this new category.
* **Icons, Icons, Icons.** I’ve added a new package called [Icons\_Silk](http://pearified.com/index.php?package=Icons_Silk) which bundles up Mark James’ great [Silk](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/) icons. Also, I re-released a bunch of packages containing variants of the [Tango Project](http://tango-project.org/) icons. You can now install [sizes ranging from 12×12 to 128×128](http://pearified.com/index.php?category=7&search=1&page=1), in four pixel increments. Those packages are further split out into alpha-transparent PNGs, and for the Internet Explorer-using crowd, versions with white, black and light gray solid backgrounds.
* **Tooltip!** Finally, after a good IM chat with Davey Shafik last night, we agreed that his new [Tooltip](http://pearified.com/index.php?package=JavaScript_Tooltip) package will have its PEAR channel home on Pearified. Check that package out — it’s very well done.

That’s all for now! Enjoy these packages, and please let me know if you find them useful.
