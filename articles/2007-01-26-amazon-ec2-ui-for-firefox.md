# Amazon EC2 UI for FireFox

*Wow,* this is cool.

If you're lucky enough to have an [Amazon
EC2](https://web.archive.org/web/20080229031945/http://www.amazon.com/ec2)
account, and are doing anything with it, you really, really need [this
Firefox
extension](https://web.archive.org/web/20080229031945/http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=609&categoryID=88)
that puts an easy-to-use interface on top of most of the EC2
administrative tasks.

> Another tip: if you are using puTTY to access your EC2 instance, be sure to stick a newline character at the end of the .pem file that Amazon provides you. Otherwise puttygen won’t be able to load it and create a .ppk file from it. Hope that saves someone the 45 minutes of frustration that it caused me
