# Zend PHP 5 Certification: Me Too

So I passed the [Zend PHP 5 Certification Exam](http://www.zend.com/education/php_5_certification) this morning. 😊

While not necessarily blog-worthy in and of itself, I wanted to write about the experience for the benefit of those developers who are on the fence about taking the exam, and for employers who may or may not know about the exam or consider it valuable.

First off, as [Davey blogged last week](http://pixelated-dreams.com/archives/240-Zend-PHP-5-Certified.html), the PHP 5 exam is much, much better than the PHP 4 exam. I felt that the questions were more challenging, and that they were more representative of real knowledge and understanding of PHP 5.

If you’re not sure if the exam is worth taking, I believe that it is (for whatever that’s worth). While I’ve gotten a bit of a rep as a [Zend basher](http://www.google.com/search?q=zend+site%3Akillersoft.com/randomstrings) over the past year, I firmly support the certification program (especially the PHP 5 version).

As a developer, in the year or so since I’ve taken it, I’ve gotten a number of opportunities thrown my way that I don’t think I’d have seen if I hadn’t taken the exam.

As an employer (I’m the guy with the final say-so on the developers we hire or don’t hire at Mashery), I can say without hesitation that I am more likely to call in a Zend Certified Engineer for an interview than Average Joe PHP Guy without certification. Granted, I haven’t been fortunate enough to GET a resume from someone I didn’t already know who was a ZCE … but it’s the first thing I look for when I get resumes in.

We often get candidates who have a mixture of programming experience, without a real PHP focus. When asked about that, most of them say “Oh, I could learn PHP in a day.” I believe that most of those hotshots would fail the PHP 5 Certification Exam.

Of course they would. After all, when someone says something like that, they mean “I can figure out enough to get by” in a day, not “I can become an expert in a day.” The thing is, I don’t want people who can “get by.” We’re building some complex OOP PHP 5 stuff here, and “getting by” doesn’t cut it here.

In fact, I’m considering making passing the ZCE the final step of our hiring process for PHP people. It’s much cheaper for us to pay for someone’s testing fee and use the result as a determining factor in hiring than it is for us to hire someone based on a hunch on someone’s skill/knowledge gleaned from interviews. I recommend that others who are serious about finding competent PHP developers do the same.
