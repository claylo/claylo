# CLI.php 1.0b1 Released

May 21, 2002 -- KillerSoft is pleased to announce the released of a new PHP class module. CLI.php is intended to be as direct of a translation as possible of Stalker's CLI.pm Perl module (based on version 2.4.7).

Efforts have been made to mimic the formatting of the subroutine calls made by CLI.pm, so that we can all maximize on the value of the documentation of CLI.pm and the CLI module itself.

Perhaps someday we'll do a version of the documentation, to translate that to PHP syntax as well ... but that'll be a day when we've got some more free time. ;-)

Meanwhile, we hope you all find this as useful as we do!
