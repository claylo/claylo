# Rebooted!

As I mentioned in [February](http://www.killersoft.com/randomstrings/2006/02/16/blog-overhaul-in-progress/), I’ve had a blog and site overhaul underway for awhile. Like a lot of developers, I always find it hard to take the time to work on my own site.

With the aid of [the excellent Matt Brett](http://mattbrett.com/), I’ve got a new theme in place for this site. I can’t thank Matt enough — he’s been a pleasure to work with, and I highly recommend him.

I’ve scrambled a bit this evening to get this in place as part of [the May 1 CSS Reboot event](http://www.cssreboot.com/). Not sure if I’ll have time to crank out the new [Pearified.com](http://www.pearified.com/) design by the evening of May 1, but I’ll do what I can. If I can’t get to it, I’ll certainly roll it out before the end of the week.

Please let me know if you find any issues or errors with the new site — any that you find are my fault, not Matt’s.
