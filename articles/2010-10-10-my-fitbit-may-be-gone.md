# My Fitbit May Be Gone

**A Geek's Fitbit Ownership Post-mortem**

I'm not exactly sure how long my Fitbit has been missing. It's
definitely lost, and I'm not all that worked up over it.

I've had a love/hate relationship with the thing since it arrived in
February. I think it's cool that it allows me to track general
activity, but the lack of an API pisses me off to no end. I stopped
using the website to check on status and enter activity a long time ago.
I have more important things demanding my attention when I'm sitting in
front of my computer.

If I were able to review progress and enter foods, water consumption and
activities during "downtime", such as: while waiting for a BART train,
while eating breakfast, etc, I would totally be on top of it. I even
went so far as to write a scraper for the Fitbit portal after I got
tired of waiting for an official Fitbit API. It's been promised for so
long that I don't care anymore if it ever arrives.

I'm a developer. For months I was passionate about the Fitbit, and
purchased several of them for family members. Despite chomping at the
bit in private (via emails) and in public (my TechCrunch Disrupt Hackday
entry in May 2010, plus several tweets and blog posts), for a Fitbit
API, Fitbit has been content to let my enthusiasm dissipate. (I'm not
alone\--dozens of other developers have been similarly frustrated. Just
look around their forums, or Google a bit.)

So what, you say? I don't have any published iPhone or Android apps.
Providing an API might have done nothing for Fitbit, as far as it
relates to me.

On the other hand, it might've. An app for Fitbit tracking and input is
one of the first app concepts that I've been really motivated by. I'm
a guy who needs to lose weight, and I've been eager to combine that
need with the Fitbit \*and\* my fondness for my iPhone.

Nine months later, I've given up. I'm sure that a public API will be
available eventually. They gave access to some kind of API to Google
Health, so it stands to reason that someday they'll give access to
enough other people that the mobile monitoring and input that I want
will be available.

By then, however, I won't care. It took me over a week to notice that
my Fitbit was indeed gone \-- I thought during most of that time that it
was sitting on its charger. It's not there, and after five additional
minutes of looking for it, I figured my time was better spent writing
this post than continuing to hunt for it. During that five minutes of
looking, I realized that I hadn't looked at my stats in at least a week
prior to losing it \-- probably more like a month.

By not giving me a way to make Fitbit sticky for myself or for others,
I'll never participate in any of the recurring revenue features the
Fitbit team spent their time building instead of exposing a public API.
Perhaps by the time they get around to doing it, they'll have reached a
critical mass and bitchy developers like me won't matter. (Though I'd
argue that bitchy developers like me already don't matter to Fitbit.)

It'll probably never hurt them, and that's fine. I wish them no ill
will. I'm a startup guy myself, and wish to see my fellow startup
brethren be successful.

Still, I figured it noteworthy to document the arc I've been through:

* product love
* gifting product to family
* volunteering to beta test the API at no cost (I know a little about APIs)
* publicly calling out the company for their lack of follow-through on API promises
* apathy
* calling them out again
* over week passes before I notice I don't know where my Fitbit is

I hope this is helpful to Fitbit, or to someone. There's no telling how
many customers you lose, or don't ever reach in the first place, by
choosing to de-prioritize an open API.

> I too just lost my fitbit but for me it's like one less hastle to have to deal with. It has been atleast two weeks since I checked my stats because I literally don't have the time to when I'm at my desk.It they would allow developers like yourself to create a desktop program or at very least an iPhone app I maybe inclined to purchase another one but since not I am moving on.
