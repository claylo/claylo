# Chmod Cheatsheet

If you’re like me, either you or someone you work with forgets the details of octal notation for \*nix file systems from time to time. I know I space out on it occasionally.

While playing around with “[protaculous](http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/?p=225)” a little bit on my [BART](http://www.bart.gov/) commutes, I whipped up a little octal notation interactive cheatsheet. It seemed like it might be useful to others, so I put it up at [http://per.ms](http://per.ms/).

Got a code that you can’t remember the meaning of? Just click the numbers below the checkbox grid on [http://per.ms](http://per.ms/), and the correct corresponding checkboxes will be checked for you as a reminder.

Hope you find it useful on those days when your memory is a little hazy.
