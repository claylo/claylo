# Pearified Progress

As [Josh mentioned](http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/archives/2005/08/02/javascript-goodness/trackback/), I have made some progress getting the [Pearified](http://pearified.com/ ) project going, and have added some cool JavaScript packages to the (now out of date) Smarty package.

I’ll be releasing a PEAR-installable phpMyAdmin through Pearified soon (probably next week), and am working on getting forums and mailing lists set up as well. I’m traveling right now, so it’s tough to find some time to make updates.

But, I’ve got a nice packaging routine in place, which is making getting new packages of non-traditional projects (not traditional PEAR-style libraries, that is) put together very quickly. Keep an eye out on Pearified.com for some new packages very soon.

Also, you may want to check out the [Everything Pearified](http://everything.pearified.com/) blog, which is how I intend to manage the support/info area of the Pearified site.
